> I already have an express typescript api boilerplate, so i just wanted to create the same result with other web framework. I'm also building [zssn](https://github.com/kauefraga/zssn) with the Fastify framework and i enjoyed it.

### Features

- Server built with [Fastify](https://fastify.io) framework that is fast and low overhead.
- The simplicity of the structure is something: http (with the server), core (business logic) and infra (database...)

## ‚¨áÔ∏è How to install and use it

1. Clone the repository and rename it.
2. Install the dependencies.
3. Build and start the server.
4. Done! Access it at http://localhost:3333/v1.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kauefraga/fastify-ts-api.git {your-project-name}

cd {your-project-name}

pnpm i --frozen-lockfile

pnpm build
pnpm start

curl http://localhost:3333/v1
```

## üõ† Technologies

The following packages have been used to build the project:

- [Fastify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fastify) - An efficient server implies a lower cost of the infrastructure, a better responsiveness under load and happy users. Framework based on plugins.
  - [@fastify/cors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fastify/cors) - Allows you to control who can access your Fastify application.
  - [@fastify/rate-limit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fastify/rate-limit) - Controls the request rate limit of your API.
- [Typescript](https://typescriptlang.org), [tsx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tsx) and [tsup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tsup) - Improve the DX by adding type safety and a blazingly fast execution/build provided by esbuild
- [Eslint](https://npm.im/eslint-config-airbnb-typescript) - Code ruler/styler with Airbnb style guide for typescript.
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev) - Implements Jest but with its own ESbuider (out of box typescript, esmodules and so on).
